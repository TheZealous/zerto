## Description:
This script is meant for Linux machines failing over from vCenter to Azure or AWS
with on source (vCenter) static IP configurations.

It sets the network adapter to look for DHCP so that the public cloud 
can push the proper IP to the machine. On boot in Azure it will backup and
delete the file which is auto-generated by udev /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
so that NIC naming is not changed on failback from Azure.

## Tested with the following:
- CentOS Versions: 6.3, 6.9, 7.0

## Installation:
1. Create a new folder: /tmp/reip
2. extract files first or upload/unzip reip_v5.zip onto the VM to /tmp/reip 
3. command line run: cd /tmp/reip
4. Run: chmod +x ./reipinstaller.sh
5. Run: ./reipinstaller.sh
6. (optional) if prior version exists run ./reipuninstaller.sh first
